# Game Boy Emulator Learning Project

This is a Nintendo Game Boy emulator project in C, intended as a fun learning
project for me. I have never worked on a large C project, but I always loved
the Game Boy consoles and I have an interest in systems programming, so 
I decided to try this as a learning project with a fun product.

The project only depends on SDL2 and C standard library routines.
